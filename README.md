### Hi there 👋

I'm a graduated Computer Science. I'm a general programmer, learning to fulfill my childhood dream to become a Game Developer. 
I have strong passion for video games since I was young, and want to one day make my own game where everybody could enjoy or perhaps to make them suffer like FromSoftware.

I'm fluent in Vietnamese and am highly proficient in English. In addition, I'm currently learning French.
